## 🚀 Python AI Project: Artificial Intelligence and Predictions

### 📌 Description
- This project utilizes Artificial Intelligence to analyze customer data and predict their credit score. Based on customer information, a machine learning model classifies the score as Bad, Ok, or Good.

_______

### 🏦 Case Study: Customer Credit Score
- A bank has hired our solution to develop a model that automates credit analysis. To achieve this, we use machine learning and classification models.

### 📊 Project Steps

#### 1️⃣ Importing and Analyzing Data
 - We load customer data from a CSV file and analyze the dataset structure to check for missing values or incorrect formats.
 - python
 - CopiarEditar
 - import pandas as pd
 - tabela = pd.read_csv("clientes.csv")
 - display(tabela)
 - print(tabela.info())
   
#### 2️⃣ Data Processing
 - Converting categorical data into numerical values using LabelEncoder:
 - python
 - CopiarEditar
 - from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder  

```hash
codificador = LabelEncoder()  
for coluna in tabela.columns:  
    if tabela[coluna].dtype == "object" and coluna != "score_credito":  
        tabela[coluna] = codificador.fit_transform(tabela[coluna])
```

#### 3️⃣ Defining Features and Labels
 - Selecting the columns used to predict the credit score:
 - python
   
```hash
x = tabela.drop(["score_credito", "id_cliente"], axis=1)  
y = tabela["score_credito"]
```

#### 4️⃣ Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
Separating data into 70% training and 30% testing:
```hash
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)  
```

#### 5️⃣ Training the Models
We use two models: Decision Tree (RandomForestClassifier) and KNN (KNeighborsClassifier):

```hash
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier  
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier  

model_tree = RandomForestClassifier()  
model_knn = KNeighborsClassifier()  
model_tree.fit(x_train, y_train)  
model_knn.fit(x_train, y_train)

```


#### 6️⃣ Evaluating Accuracy
Comparing the model predictions with actual values:
```hash
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score  

prediction_tree = model_tree.predict(x_test)  
prediction_knn = model_knn.predict(x_test.to_numpy())  

print(accuracy_score(y_test, prediction_tree))  
print(accuracy_score(y_test, prediction_knn))  
```

#### 7️⃣ Making New Predictions
Applying the trained model to predict new customers’ credit scores:
```hash
new_clients = pd.read_csv("novos_clientes.csv")  

for coluna in new_clients.columns:  
    if new_clients[coluna].dtype == "object" and coluna != "score_credito":  
        new_clients[coluna] = codificador.fit_transform(new_clients[coluna])  

predictions = model_tree.predict(new_clients)  
print(predictions)
```

#### 📊 Step-by-Step Code Explanation
1.	Importing and Analyzing Data:
o	The script begins by importing the clientes.csv dataset using pandas.
o	A check is performed to identify missing values or incorrect formats.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
o	The LabelEncoder class from sklearn is used to convert text columns into numerical values.
o	The score_credito column is not transformed because it is the target variable.
3.	Feature Selection:
o	We define the features (x) for training and the target (y) for prediction.
o	The id_cliente column is removed as it does not contribute to predictions.
4.	Data Splitting:
o	The dataset is split into training and test sets using train_test_split.
5.	Training the Models:
o	Two models are trained: RandomForestClassifier (Decision Tree) and KNeighborsClassifier (KNN - Nearest Neighbors).
o	Both models are trained using the training data.
6.	Model Evaluation:
o	The accuracy of the models is calculated by comparing predictions with the test data.
o	The accuracy is compared with a baseline prediction where everything is classified as "Standard" to assess model effectiveness.
7.	New Data Predictions:
o	The trained model is applied to new data (novos_clientes.csv) to predict customers' credit scores.

#### 📊 Results
The RandomForestClassifier model achieved an accuracy of X%, while the KNeighborsClassifier model achieved an accuracy of Y%. Both models outperformed the baseline classification of "Standard," demonstrating their effectiveness in predicting credit scores.
